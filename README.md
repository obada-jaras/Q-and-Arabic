# **Q&Arabic - An Automatic Question & Answering FAQ Generator**

Q&Arabic is a natural language processing (NLP) framework that automatically generates Arabic frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers from given material. The system is designed to generate questions from a text and provide answers, supporting applications like creating FAQs for websites, articles, or exams from Arabic documents. Users can input a text or upload a document, specify the number of desired questions, select generation models, and the system will automatically generate related questions and answers.

The project has successfully moved through its implementation and evaluation phases, culminating in a robust application that leverages advanced NLP and Machine Learning techniques. It uses transformer models like [AraBERT](https://github.com/aub-mind/arabert/tree/master/arabert), [AraT5](https://github.com/UBC-NLP/araT5), [AraELECTRA](https://github.com/aub-mind/arabert/tree/master/araelectra), and [AraGPT](https://github.com/aub-mind/arabert/tree/master/aragpt2) for nuanced understanding and processing of Arabic language texts.
