# **Q&Arabic - An Automatic Question & Answering FAQ Generator**

Q&Arabic is a natural language processing (NLP) framework that automatically creates Arabic frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers from a given material. The project seeks to accelerate the process of creating FAQs by utilizing NLP techniques to find and extract the most pertinent information from a document and present it in a clear and succinct question and answer format. We use BERT for question answering and T5 for question generation, both of which are deep learning models that have shown great success in various NLP tasks. The system is designed to support the Arabic language specifically.

**Note: The provided work is a thorough exploration of transformer models, related datasets, and existing research. We are now moving towards the implementation and evaluation phases.**
